    "## This is just a simple Python movie recommender system using the content-based filtering. It takes the old trusty TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) and cosine similarity to find out similar movies between the movies' overviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's an overview of this awesome:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Import the required libraries: pandas to handle the dataset, TfidfVectorizer to convert the text given into a matrix of tf-idf features, and linear_kernel to compute the cosine similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Read the movies dataset from a CSV file.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. It removes any rows in the dataset where the movie overview is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. It instantiates a TF-IDF vectorizer transforming the series of 'overview' column of the dataset into a feature matrix of TF-IDF features. This matrix basically gives an indication of the relative importance of every word in the overview with respect to the document as well as the corpus.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. It calculates cosine similarity matrix between TF-IDF matrix, representing the cosine of the angle between each pair of movies in the high dimensional space. This score represents similarity and is going to be used to measure how similar are two movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. It defines a function get_recommendations(), which takes movie title as input and outputs 10 most similar movies. Retrieves the index of the input movie, get the similarity scores of all movies with that movie, sort the similaritie scores in descending order, get the indices of the top 10 movies and return their titles.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Finally, it tests the function with the movie 'The Dark Knight Rises' and prints the recommended movies."

It is anticipated to bear a similar aspect in comparison because they are both part of the same trilogy and therefore likely to bear identical themes as well as may have matching characters in their overviews.\n",

    "\n",
    "5. Batman Begins:  This should be very similar to the 'The Dark Knight Rises' since being the first movie under 'Dark Knight' trilogy.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Slow Burn: This isn't a Batman movie but maybe some of the similar themes when looked at in its overview that could include things such as crime, justice, or mystery.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice: This too is a Batman movie so therefore probably be expected with other Batman movies.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. JFK: This is not a Batman movie, but it could have similar themes of crime, justice, or conspiracy in its overview.\n",
